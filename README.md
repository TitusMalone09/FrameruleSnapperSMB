FrameruleSnapperSMB

This is a tool that causes any splits in LiveSplit (excluding the final split) to snap to the nearest multiple of ~0.34919 seconds. This is meant for Super Mario Bros. or Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels (2J) speedrunning.
This is useful because level endings only occur on a cycle of ~0.34919 seconds. Those who use manual splits are only human, and therefore may be off by a small increment of time. In this speedrun, though, knowledge of which cycle of ~0.34919 seconds (one framerule) you are on is crucial.
All splits will be snapped to the nearest framerule, increasing accuracy. Note that this tool is meant for manual splits only. If running on emulator, please use the automatic splits built into LiveSplit instead.
Additionally, note that in the last level of these runs, it is common for every frame to be accounted for. I made it so that on the last split, it only snaps to the nearest ~0.01664 seconds (one frame). Yes, one framerule is 21 frames.
Please download the .zip and consult instructions.txt for setup. Have fun, and happy speedrunning!
